# Mixed Messages: Holy Messages Batman!

## Description
I built this project to complete a portfolio project in my Full-Stack Engineering course on Codecademy. Each time the program runs, it prints a comdeic, 60s-style message that Robin might exclaim to Batman in the TV show. 

## How to use
Clone to your local machine, and run in the terminal using the command `node holyMessagesBatman.js`

## Requirements
You'll need a local instalation of Node.js on your computer.
